# Argilla Demo
A demonstration project to show the various components of the Argilla Framework working together.
The demonstrations is designed to be useful for large audience presentations.

For full details of the Argilla Framework please refer to https://github.com/gregfullard/ArgillaFramework

Components in the stack:
* GitLab SCM Server
* Jenkins Server
* Artifactory Server
* SonarQube Server
* Apache Web Server
* Apache Sling Web Application
* Apache Camel Integration Application
* Node Server

The demonstration uses Docker Compose to bootstrap a full development environment for easy demonstration

Other Ideas:
* Hygieia
* Prometheus
* Some method to visualise the environment in real time
* NGINX as a Reverse Proxy
* HAProxy with multiple Web Servers
* Monitoring Solution
* ElasticSearch
* MQ

The Pipeline will include:
* Generate build number
* Generate HTML Documentation
* Generate PDF Documentation
* Deploy Web Application to Sling
* Deploy REST services to Camel Servers
* Run Cucumber tests with Serenity
* Publish Test Results to the Apache web Server

## Prerequisites
Docker
Docker-Compose
nodejs
npm

## First Run
First ensure that you have credentials for Docker Hub

```
cd env
./first_run.sh
docker-compose up
```

Take note that a number of manual steps are still needed on the first run to get everything
up and running for a full demonstration (I'll hopefully automate these over time)

         * Type = api
         * Create and Copy
     * Jenkins
         * Manage Jenkins > Configure System > GitLab
         * Connection Name = GitLab
         * GitLab Host URL = http://argilla-gitlab:80
         * Credentials > Add > GitLab Api key (ID = GitLab)
         * Test Connection
         * Save
* Jenkins Pipeline
     * Open Jenkinc Blue Ocean interface
     * New Pipeline
     * ssh://git@argilla-gitlab/root/ArgillaDemo.git
     * Copy the SSH key as provided by Jenkins
     * Open GitLab
         * Settings > SSH Keys
         * Paste Keys
         * Save
     * (Back in Jenkins) Create Pipeline

## Kill'em all
If you want to totally remove all containers from your machine:

```
docker-compose down
cd env
./clean.sh
```

## Using the environment (Preparing for a demo)
After the initial run (and manual steps performed), you can start and stop the environment using these commands

```
docker-compose start
```

```
docker-compose stop
```

## Notes

If the local host machine can't connect to the drone, it is likely due the the existence of a virtual bridge network
ith the same IP (192.168.42.1). You can double-check by running ifconfig

To kill this bridge, run:

```
sudo ifconfig virbr1 down
```
